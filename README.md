## What is Mindset

- Get Mindset is a platform that offers tools and resources to help individuals develop a growth mindset, improve mental resilience, and achieve personal and professional growth, featuring programs with celebrity mentors.

## Why I choose Mindset

- I chose this project because I am interested in K-pop, and it includes content led by K-pop celebrities. Additionally, the focus on mindset aligns with my belief in the importance of mental strength, which also influenced my decision.

## Core Focus: HTML & CSS Layout Design

- In this project, you can see how I applied the basics of HTML and CSS. It wasn't built to be responsive, as I focused primarily on creating the layout.
- âœ…And you can see the details of the CSS I used through [ðŸ”—this link(To be added)](). Please check it out!
